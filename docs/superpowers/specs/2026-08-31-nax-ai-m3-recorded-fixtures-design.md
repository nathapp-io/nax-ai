# M3 — recorded fixtures: design

**Status:** approved, not implemented. Plan: [`../plans/2026-08-31-nax-ai-m3-recorded-fixtures.md`](../plans/2026-08-31-nax-ai-m3-recorded-fixtures.md).

## The problem M3 actually solves

Protocol correctness currently rests on scripted events that assert the mapping is
*self-consistent* rather than *right*. Every test in `test/protocols/` hand-writes the pi
events it then asserts on, so a wrong belief about what pi emits produces a green suite.

## The defect in what M2 left behind

`test/live/support/record.ts` writes nax-ai's own `ProtocolEvent[]` — the mapper's
**output**. Replaying that asserts nothing about the mapping: a regression in
`pi-client.ts` would simply be re-recorded as the new expectation. The two existing
fixtures (`deepseek-text.json`, `deepseek-tool.json`) are at this level and must be
re-recorded rather than extended.

**Fixtures must capture the input side**: pi's `AssistantMessageEvent` stream plus the
observed HTTP response, replayed through `createPiProtocol` with a stubbed `deps.stream`,
asserting the `ProtocolEvent`s that come out.

`PiDeps` is already exactly that seam — M1 built it, and `createPiProtocol(name, deps)`
takes it injected. M3 uses the seam rather than adding one.

## Coverage

Four registry keys, all reachable from credentials already present in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`:

| Protocol | Recorded via | Auth |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `anthropic-messages` | `opencode-go` | api-key |
| `openai-completions` | `opencode-go` | api-key |
| `openai-responses` | `opencode-go` | api-key |
| `openai-codex-responses` | `openai-codex` | oauth |

Plus one **error-path** fixture, which no test has ever covered: the `onResponse` capture
that `classifyHttpError` and `parseRetryAfter` depend on has never met a real failure.

## Ruling: the thinking-signature gap stays open, and stays stated

`opencode-go` and `minimax` speak `anthropic-messages` but are **gateways implementing
Anthropic's wire format**, not Anthropic. For event-shape mapping that is equivalent. For
the thinking-block `signature` specifically — the field PR #4 added and nothing has
verified live — a gateway may not emit one at all.

M3 records whatever the gateway emits. **If no real signature appears, the fixture says so
and the roadmap says so.** Recording a signature-less thinking block and describing the
result as "thinking blocks covered" would be the same error M2 made: reporting evidence of
a shape as evidence of a behaviour.

Closing it properly needs a first-party Anthropic API key (billing, not subscription OAuth,
which is prohibited — see the OAuth policy). That is a follow-up, not M3.

## Redaction

Fixtures are committed to a public repository. Recorded response headers are filtered to an
allowlist — `retry-after`, `content-type`, `x-request-id` — because `parseRetryAfter` reads
only the first and the rest are provenance. Everything else, including anything
cookie-shaped or authorization-shaped, is dropped rather than trusted to be harmless.

Recorded events contain model output text, which is the point of the fixture.

## Non-goals

- No change to `src/`. M3 is evidence, not behaviour.
- No re-recording on every run. Fixtures are committed artifacts, refreshed deliberately.
- The live suite stays opt-in and excluded from `bun run test`.
